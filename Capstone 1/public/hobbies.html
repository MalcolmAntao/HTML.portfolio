            In my leisure time, I indulge in a variety of hobbies that bring joy and fulfillment to my life. One of my passions lies in strumming the strings of my guitar, where I find solace and creative expression through music. Additionally, I harbor a deep love for sports, relishing the adrenaline rush and camaraderie that comes with playing. Beyond these pursuits, I also immerse myself in the captivating worlds of photography and videography, capturing moments and stories through the lens of my camera. Furthermore, I explore the realms of motion design and UI/UX design, honing my skills in visual storytelling and user experience enhancement. Whether it's mastering a new chord progression, scoring a goal on the field, or creating captivating visual content, these activities not only provide relaxation but also serve as avenues for personal growth and exploration.
